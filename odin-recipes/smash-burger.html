    <h1>Yummy smash burgers!</h1>

    <p>The Smashburger was popularized by a fast-casual hamburger restaurant chain of the same name founded in Denver, Colorado.</p>
    <p>They have a proprietary system of smashing their burgers and cooking them quickly. It creates a thin patty, with a caramelized, crispy crust. Top it with cheese and all the fixings and you’re in for a real treat.</p>
<ul>    
    <li>1 pound 80/20 ground chuck</li>
    <li>4 potato hamburger buns</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Loosely divide the ground beef into four even balls. Season the balls of beef with a 1/8 teaspoon burger seasoning mix. Don’t worry about completely covering them. You can add more seasoning when they are cooking.</li>
    <li>Wrap a heavy skillet (cast iron works well) with some foil, you will use this to smash the burgers. I use a smaller 8-inch cast iron skillet, but any smaller size will work.

        Turn on the fan over the stove and open a window to help with air flow.
        
        In a large skillet or griddle (I do not recommend using non-stick) set over medium-high heat add one tablespoon of butter. Once the butter has melted, add the beef balls.
        
        Place the foil wrapped skillet or a spatula over the beef balls and smash them into flat disks. Smash each burger for 10 seconds, one at a time, applying a lot of pressure to it. Repeat until all the burgers are smashed.</li>
    <li>Season the smashburgers with another 1/8 teaspoon burger seasoning mix. Allow them to continue to cook for about 90 seconds until the juices start to bubble from the burger. Use a sturdy metal spatula to flip the burgers, being sure to scrap up any caramelization.
    </li>
    <li>Build a smashburger by adding some sauce, approximately 1 tablespoon, to the bottom of the burger bun. Add lettuce over the top of the sauce, then add a smashburger, and finally top with sliced red onion and tomato. Continue until all smashburgers are assembled.

        Serve immediately with fries and a cold drink.</li>
